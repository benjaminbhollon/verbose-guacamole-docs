# Writing Documentation
Writing documentation is a simple and easy way to use your writing skills to give back to the community!

## Making Edits
Each page on this documentation website ([docs.verboseguacamole.com](https://docs.verboseguacamole.com)) has an "Edit on Github" link at the top. Find a page you wish to contribute to and click that link.

You will need to sign in to your Github account to continue. If you do not have one, go ahead and create one. This account will be used to identify you as a contributor.

You will be shown a text editor in which you can edit the raw markdown of the page you have chosen. When you are finished, click "Preview" and ensure that everything appears correctly.

Finally, scroll to the bottom, describe what you changed (this is a git commit message, and we prefer using the imperative tense), and click "Propose changes". Another Verbose Guacamole contributor will review your changes and decide whether to accept them.

## Creating New Pages
Creating a new documentation page requires more technical know-how, so the simplest way is to [create a Github issue](https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/verbose-guacamole-docs/issues/new) asking someone to create it for you. Make sure you check back so that you can edit the file once it's created!

If you have a fair knowledge of how git works, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create your file in the `/docs/` directory under the proper subdirectory
3. The filename will reflect the URL, while the page title (denoted as a first-level header [`#`]) reflects the displayed text in the table of contents
4. Once you've made your changes, commit them to your fork
5. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/verbose-guacamole-docs/compare) to merge your changes into the official repository
